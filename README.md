# Introduction
This project was made for the Object Oriented Course, where in a group of 2, we had to make a BookStore program.
We used Java,JavaFX and MySql for database.
Our program consists of 3 user levels:
-Admin
-Manager
-User
Admins can create,edit delete account for other users while also having permission to add,edit,delete books.
Managers and Admins can also look at detailed stats.
Each time an account or book is modified, the change is reflected on the database too.
After ordering a book, a bill is generated to keep track of sales, amount earned.
